**Code and files from my Summer 2019 GVSU Research Experince for Undergraduates in Pure Mathematics project.**

The final results are summarized in the "final_paper.pdf" file.  To reproduce our original results, download the repository and run each of the Mathematica scripts in the "Mathematica Analysis" folder.  Note, you must have a valid copy Mathematica installed on your machine.  

My partner for this project was Sarah Van (now at UNC), and we were mentored by the wonderful [Professor William Dickinson](https://faculty.gvsu.edu/dickinsw/index.html).
